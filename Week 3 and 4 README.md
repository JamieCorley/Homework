Homework for Week 3 and 4

I was a little behind on the homework but I've added Javascript and new CSS styling to my portfolio page.  In addition to the lectures and resources linked in the slides, I've found that the Javascript & JQuery book by Jon Duckett is very helpful.  I ordered it off Amazon a few days ago.

Homework this week took about four hours.
